# Native iPad and Pencil sharing checkpoint

## October18 current state

The installed development stack is iPad46, native Mac31 and Vision53. The user
resumed the deferred headset update; Vision53 was installed in place and its
exact version/container/running executable independently verified. It adds
bounded diagnostics, not a latency repair. Mac31 and iPad46 were not restarted.

Targeted Sharing qualification is complete for local 2× availability through Mac
focus changes, clean Artist modifier release, Fit deferral until actual Pencil
lift, and Hand navigation moving only the local view with drawing resuming.
Direct Pencil alignment and the optional movable map remain accepted. Two Mac
workstation connection losses remain unexplained, including one session with
zero Pencil samples. Sustained latency, genuine OS cancellation, final Host
release receipt and the broader platform matrix remain open. Image promotion
stays held; this is a development review checkpoint, not a release.

Live upstream refs checked October18 remain main
`58f4df097c1cdf11bf6b4b429701f156e2b10109` and Apple integration
`e8d8536486bf2eb0d7080aab8965f12d7d87b0af`, both already ancestors of this branch.
The unpublished suffix was previously rebased after merging main into the
published checkpoint. Its 17 upstream Qt/Linux/test paths remain unchanged from
main; the native recipe retains its explicitly reviewed common-C pin. No new
rebase or dependency change is required at this snapshot.

## Development history

October10, 2026: the user accepted the installed iPad31 editor refinement and
requested publication of the completed development work. This checkpoint is
for review; it does not change the shipping platform matrix or release packages.

Subsequent feedback found menu overlap and remote Pencil interruption on editor
entry. Development build33 was accepted for duplicate movement, corner resizing
and landscape main/editor toolbar clearance and published in the existing draft
PR13 at `c3dfc42bb4272ab18616e022b441fdbbe9497bc1`. Editor peer continuity remains
a separate physical gate. See
[the current controls boundary](ipad-custom-controls.md#menu-protection-and-editor-continuity--ipad32).

The authored editor aspect and editing check from42 remain accepted. Local
Fit/2× operating-view build43 is now installed and open on the new M5 after
the user's disconnected installation authorization. App inventory and its exact
running executable verify43/0.1.0; physical zoom qualification remains pending.
The subsequent user trial reports severe intermittent Pencil latency: normal
speed for a period followed by very slow response. This is not an accepted43
result. Retained logs and an unsynchronized, largely idle device profile do not
yet identify the delayed stage or establish that zoom caused it. Earlier editor
and input acceptance remains recorded; new zoom qualification is held during
the investigation.

The failure was in Pencil Sharing through Vision52 to Flame-01. Disabling the
reference image initially recovered drawing, but the user's later image-on and
image-off trials both worked normally; enabling AVP Tailscale made no difference.
These observations do not establish an image or Tailscale cause. A read-only
Host snapshot identified Flame-01 package1.1.024, with active services and a
normalized tablet present; unavailable logs do not prove a healthy input queue.

Diagnostic candidates44/53 add bounded, content-free mailbox, local send
completion, receiver scheduling and native submission counters using existing
execution paths. They do not change input/media behavior or dependency pins and
are not a latency repair. Local send completion and QUIC handoff are not Host
receipt. Fresh device compilation, focused diagnostic checks and independent signed-package
verification pass; candidates44/53
are staged, not installed. The current43/52 session remains untouched. The later
connection through Tailscale also worked with the image both on and off.

The next iPad45 UI slice makes the zoom map optional and movable: the View menu
has Show Zoom Map and Reset Map Position; a separate header moves it and × hides
it. Both iPad modes share persistent local visibility/placement. No receiver or
Host change accompanies this slice. Candidate persistence/native view/menu checks and independent signed-package
verification pass;45 was installed as an update on the M5 with its exact running
executable independently inventoried. The user accepts hide/button access, menu
restore and header movement in Desktop and Pencil Sharing. Vision52 is unchanged.

The user-authorized local Mac switch now installs and opens native Mac30 from
`dd07decfa5f1a26a664cc699d3cfce2ba725b5ae` at `/Applications/PLANK Native.app`,
retaining the previous Qt client. Fresh public compilation, independent artifact
checks and installed/running identity checks pass. It includes the bounded shared
diagnostics newer than staged Mac29. The user confirms the targeted Mac Pencil
and Artist modifier smoke check is working; optional image sharing remains
pending. See [the Mac switch](native-mac-integration.md#october-14-local-native-client-switch).

The user subsequently reports the direct iPad45 2× trial stays under the Pencil.
The direct check is resolved; Sharing image/zoom/Hand and held-contact/modifier
view changes remain separate physical checks. See [the zoom feedback](ipad-live-image.md#october-14-direct-zoom-feedback).

On October15, the user reports native Mac Sharing hover, click/drag and basic
zoom working, after a one-to-two-second startup delay. The current input question
is resolved. Held-modifier/view-change behavior remains pending; the prior
transport failure has no confirmed cause or repair. See [the current Mac result](native-mac-integration.md#october-15-targeted-input-recovery).

## Review order

The accepted upstream Apple/Mac foundation is
`e8d8536486bf2eb0d7080aab8965f12d7d87b0af`. Optional Mac tablet sharing and
display/wheel changes remain separate dependent reviews:

1. [Mac sharing](https://github.com/cnoellert/plank-client/pull/11).
2. [Mac displays and wheel](https://github.com/cnoellert/plank-client/pull/12).
3. [iPad and Pencil controls](https://github.com/cnoellert/plank-client/pull/13),
   `codex/ios-ipados-readiness`, based on `codex/native-mac-displays`.
4. Live reference image, operating zoom, editor refinements and diagnostics,
   `codex/ipad-pencil-image-overlay`, based on `codex/ios-ipados-readiness`.
   This separate draft preserves PR13's accepted checkpoint and includes the
   upstream refresh described above.

The iPad branch was rebased onto the accepted upstream foundation during
development. Publication also merges the original display review tip
`b45921542e9e7224fc6787ee0abc09e2d10e5e8a` into its ancestry. The merge tree
is exactly identical to the accepted pre-merge tree. This preserves both
histories and keeps the stacked review diff specific to the iPad/Pencil slice.
Retarget these slices upstream in dependency order after their bases are accepted.

The original iPad31 publication recorded history and documentation only.
iPad32 contains the subsequent local menu/admission correction; signed iPad31
is retained for its rollback. Signed iPad30 is also retained. The public recipe and dependency pins are unchanged
from the compiled candidates; no Host, network or app identity change accompanies
publication. Private signing profiles, device receipts and logs are excluded.

## Included behavior

- Isolated single-display iPad client: playback, audio, login, saved workstation,
  aspect-fit modes, mouse/pointer input, physical wheel and hardware keyboard.
- Direct normalized Apple Pencil pressure, navigation, hover where supported,
  and lifted-tip squeeze right-click; Apple/PC mapping for received keyboard keys.
- Native live software keyboard without a local typing preview. The tested
  full-size Pencil-held setup uses **Settings → Apple Pencil → Scribble off**.
  Credential and control-label editing remain local native forms.
- Foreground authenticated local-network Pencil publisher with separate physical
  comparison/approval, normalized pen records and bounded allowlisted shortcut
  batches. Vision and Mac receivers select one tablet source; this does not
  fabricate a raw Wacom identity.
- Normal client-screen Pencil Sharing, neutral charcoal pad, independent margins
  and mapping choices. Saved artist controls serve Desktop and Sharing together.
- Full control editor: position, dimensions, edge/neighbor snapping, key/combo
  binding, generated or custom labels, layout library and undo. Quick layout
  selection, touch-and-hold editing, visibility and transparency are in the toolbar.
  Empty-space taps dismiss the inspector; tapping a control reopens it; moves
  and resizes hide it without dropping selection or gesture state.
- Candidate36 adds persistent **Ignore finger input** for remote desktop
  finger clicks/drags. Artist controls, Pencil and physical peripherals remain
  available; local controls/forms retain their touch behavior.

## Recorded evidence

Direct iPad playback, mouse, supported resolution changes, Pencil pressure and
navigation, Space during Pencil drawing, squeeze right-click and physical-wheel
scrolling are accepted. Function keys are accepted with Fn held on a separate
Bluetooth Magic Keyboard; ordinary top-row brightness/media keys remain handled
by iPadOS. The observed Flame cursor offset resolved with Flame Tablet Margins
disabled; no client coordinate compensation was added.

Pencil sharing tip/drag/pressure, desktop reconnect, fresh strokes after rotation,
pad options and simultaneous finger shortcuts/Pencil drawing are accepted.
Subsequent user checks accepted naming, credential visibility, transparency,
shared placement/menu flow, layout shortcuts and the iPad31 inspector refinement.
These are targeted development passes, not the full platform/interruption matrix.

New M5 installation of35 is independently verified; it does not transfer the
older device's complete hardware qualification. Candidate36 checks execute the
production router and contact bodies with recording Host/stand-in touch delivery,
covering persistence, finger-drag release and stale callbacks, re-enabling input
and preservation of Artist/hardware keys, Pencil and physical mouse/wheel. Its
native device app compiles; actual OS touch delivery and Host receipt are pending.

Focused layout/migration/contact/ownership, wire/atomic admission, sanitizer
crypto and consented TCP loopback checks passed during development. Fresh target
builds and signing/profile checks passed for the candidates above. The iPad31
native editor fixture passed foreground priority, dismissal/reopening,
move/resize and one-step undo restoration. Its 77 protected source boundaries
and complete non-editor controls body match accepted30. Simulator injected
gestures do not establish physical Pencil or Host receipt; narrow-sheet swipe
was source reviewed only.

The iPad32 pure geometry checks passed menu exclusion, grouped translation,
unchanged point sizes, recoverable unavailable controls and exact Undo of
explicit draft geometry edits. Four focused native simulator cases passed
production-root admission through actual editor Done/Cancel, injected inactive
and background transitions, and genuine offer refusal. An authenticated loopback
peer remains approved across editing and admits a fresh stroke after resumption.
Actual visible/compact toolbar and consent rectangles match cached/editor
geometry and live control frames; the consent reservation clears after approval.
A preinstallation check caught and corrected an older Environment snapshot
reopening input during inactive dismissal. The corrected runtime was freshly
rebuilt and signed; the earlier candidate was never installed. Injected scene
events and simulated contacts do not establish the reported physical cause or
final Host receipt. The targeted physical iPad32 check remains pending.

## Separate remaining work

- Genuine finger cancellation and held-input release; focus/lock/background and
  final Host receipt. Local retirement or sender submission is not Host proof.
- Physical custom-control OS rotation/window sizing and four-corner pad margins;
  latency, remote tilt and continuous/horizontal scrolling.
- Mac30 optional image sending, latency under load, interruption/final Host receipt and the required OS/Host/profile matrix.
- iPhone, registered external-Wacom routes and direct iPad Wacom feasibility;
  the tested PTH-660 produced no direct USB/Bluetooth input.
- Upstream [issue9](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-client/issues/9) trust,
  exact precision, audio/input lifetime and maintained-parent reconciliation.
  Periodic video pauses and the prior Host receive-queue overflow remain open;
  further Host input-backpressure package work remains held.
- [Live reference image and dimming](ipad-live-image.md) remains a separate
  development slice. Installed iPad34 / Vision50 failed the picture usability
  trial. iPad35 is installed on the new M5; its missing-picture report is not
  isolated by current sender/receiver status yet. Vision52 / Mac29 add recovery
  from the reproduced startup latch defect; source fixtures pass but candidates
  are installed on iPad/Vision; native Mac30 is now installed with the same image behavior
  and newer bounded diagnostics. Image responsiveness remains below artist expectations
  and promotion is held. Local Fit/2× is implemented, with separate physical qualification
  pending; sharper region media and Bluetooth Pencil transport remain later work.
