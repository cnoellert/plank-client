# Native iPad and Pencil sharing checkpoint

October10, 2026: the user accepted the installed iPad31 editor refinement and
requested publication of the completed development work. This checkpoint is
for review; it does not change the shipping platform matrix or release packages.

## Review order

The accepted upstream Apple/Mac foundation is
`e8d8536486bf2eb0d7080aab8965f12d7d87b0af`. Optional Mac tablet sharing and
display/wheel changes remain separate dependent reviews:

1. [Mac sharing](https://github.com/cnoellert/plank-client/pull/11).
2. [Mac displays and wheel](https://github.com/cnoellert/plank-client/pull/12).
3. `codex/ios-ipados-readiness`, based on `codex/native-mac-displays`.

The iPad branch was rebased onto the accepted upstream foundation during
development. Publication also merges the original display review tip
`b45921542e9e7224fc6787ee0abc09e2d10e5e8a` into its ancestry. The merge tree
is exactly identical to the accepted pre-merge tree. This preserves both
histories and keeps the stacked review diff specific to the iPad/Pencil slice.
Retarget these slices upstream in dependency order after their bases are accepted.

## Runtime provenance

| Target | Compiled runtime source | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iPad31 | `1a788801d8e48ebb3498e3c029ddee2d44afe227` | Signed, installed, exact running executable independently verified; targeted editor acceptance recorded |
| Vision49 | `0a71d0c0cef026e74844dde495e186f799b32068` | Signed and installation verified; subsequent Pencil sharing accepted by the user |
| Mac26 | `0a71d0c0cef026e74844dde495e186f799b32068` | Signed and staged; physical Pencil reception pending |

Later publication commits record history and documentation only. Signed iPad30
is retained for rollback. The public recipe and dependency pins are unchanged
from the compiled candidates; no Host, network or app identity change accompanies
publication. Private signing profiles, device receipts and logs are excluded.

## Included behavior

- Isolated single-display iPad client: playback, audio, login, saved workstation,
  aspect-fit modes, mouse/pointer input, physical wheel and hardware keyboard.
- Direct normalized Apple Pencil pressure, navigation, hover where supported,
  and lifted-tip squeeze right-click; Apple/PC mapping for received keyboard keys.
- Native live software keyboard without a local typing preview. The tested
  full-size Pencil-held setup uses **Settings → Apple Pencil → Scribble off**.
  Credential and control-label editing remain local native forms.
- Foreground authenticated local-network Pencil publisher with separate physical
  comparison/approval, normalized pen records and bounded allowlisted shortcut
  batches. Vision and Mac receivers select one tablet source; this does not
  fabricate a raw Wacom identity.
- Normal client-screen Pencil Sharing, neutral charcoal pad, independent margins
  and mapping choices. Saved artist controls serve Desktop and Sharing together.
- Full control editor: position, dimensions, edge/neighbor snapping, key/combo
  binding, generated or custom labels, layout library and undo. Quick layout
  selection, touch-and-hold editing, visibility and transparency are in the toolbar.
  Empty-space taps dismiss the inspector; tapping a control reopens it; moves
  and resizes hide it without dropping selection or gesture state.

## Recorded evidence

Direct iPad playback, mouse, supported resolution changes, Pencil pressure and
navigation, Space during Pencil drawing, squeeze right-click and physical-wheel
scrolling are accepted. Function keys are accepted with Fn held on a separate
Bluetooth Magic Keyboard; ordinary top-row brightness/media keys remain handled
by iPadOS. The observed Flame cursor offset resolved with Flame Tablet Margins
disabled; no client coordinate compensation was added.

Pencil sharing tip/drag/pressure, desktop reconnect, fresh strokes after rotation,
pad options and simultaneous finger shortcuts/Pencil drawing are accepted.
Subsequent user checks accepted naming, credential visibility, transparency,
shared placement/menu flow, layout shortcuts and the iPad31 inspector refinement.
These are targeted development passes, not the full platform/interruption matrix.

Focused layout/migration/contact/ownership, wire/atomic admission, sanitizer
crypto and consented TCP loopback checks passed during development. Fresh target
builds and signing/profile checks passed for the candidates above. The iPad31
native editor fixture passed foreground priority, dismissal/reopening,
move/resize and one-step undo restoration. Its 77 protected source boundaries
and complete non-editor controls body match accepted30. Simulator injected
gestures do not establish physical Pencil or Host receipt; narrow-sheet swipe
was source reviewed only.

## Separate remaining work

- Genuine finger cancellation and held-input release; focus/lock/background and
  final Host receipt. Local retirement or sender submission is not Host proof.
- Physical custom-control OS rotation/window sizing and four-corner pad margins;
  latency, remote tilt and continuous/horizontal scrolling.
- Physical Mac26 Pencil reception and the required OS/Host/profile matrix.
- iPhone, registered external-Wacom routes and direct iPad Wacom feasibility;
  the tested PTH-660 produced no direct USB/Bluetooth input.
- Upstream [issue9](https://github.com/instinctual/plank-client/issues/9) trust,
  exact precision, audio/input lifetime and maintained-parent reconciliation.
  Periodic video pauses and the prior Host receive-queue overflow remain open;
  further Host input-backpressure package work remains held.
- [Live image, dimming and magnification](ipad-live-image.md), plus Bluetooth
  Pencil transport, remain separate planned features.
