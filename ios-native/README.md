# Native iPad pilot

Separate development application, `com.instinctual.plank.ipadpilot`, using the
existing native session/media services at their current source paths. Shipping
Mac and Vision app identities and targets are unchanged. iPadOS 26 and Apple
Silicon device/simulator are the initial compile scope, not a final OS matrix.

## First slice

One saved workstation, login, one aspect-fit desktop, video/audio, direct finger
mouse emulation, indirect pointer buttons, physical wheel and hardware keyboard.
Local controls live above the canvas; opening a control sheet retires locally
held input. The toolbar's up-chevron hides PLANK's navigation/status bars and
expands the canvas. A small down-chevron restores the toolbar. This preference
persists; the connection screen always shows its navigation bar. Hiding or
restoring controls cancels held local input without restarting the stream or
changing the remote display mode. iPadOS retains its own window management and
system gestures. Build 9 replaces the compose-and-send keyboard sheet with live
on-screen typing (see below). Rotation/size changes cancel the current local contact. Background
ends this pilot's stream and requires reconnect; it does not log out Linux.

Build 2 simplifies resolution selection to **Balanced (1920×1200)** and
**Sharper (2560×1600)**, both 16:10. Existing bookmarks retain their saved mode
as an additional choice until explicitly changed. The new-bookmark default is
Balanced. Rotation resizes the local aspect-fit viewport; it does not renegotiate
the Host or crop/stretch the desktop.

These are interim supported modes, not exact iPad fit. The test iPad Air's
landscape panel is 2360×1640 (59:41). The pinned virtual-startup Host mode list
has no exact match. The maintained parent already documents optional bounded
physical-startup display matching (`0x400000`), but that contract explicitly
keeps headless virtual startup preset-only. Exact-fit support must use a
capability-qualified existing matching path where available, and qualified
virtual EDID modes for headless workstations. Do not blindly send arbitrary
sizes or stretch/crop the image to claim native fit. No Host deployment is
included in this pilot change.

Build 3 adds Apple Pencil through the existing normalized pen protocol (type 7),
separate from mouse emulation and raw Wacom identity. The Host must advertise
pen support (`0x01`), and a selected raw Relay disables this pen path. Actual
coalesced contact samples carry subpixel coordinates, force divided by UIKit's
reported maximum, and altitude/azimuth converted to Host tilt direction. Hover
uses UIKit's normalized distance. Predicted samples and late estimated-property
updates are not sent. Build 3 does not map squeeze, double-tap, eraser or barrel roll.
USB-C Pencil does not provide pressure sensitivity; an unknown/zero force range
sends zero pressure rather than inventing a measurement.

Rotation, canvas dimension changes, control sheets, focus loss and local source
handoff request cancel/proximity leave. Lift and start a fresh stroke after a
geometry change. Terminal up is accepted even at the last move's timestamp;
stale moves cannot restart a cancelled contact. Finger/pointer movement cannot
interrupt an active Pencil stroke. Settings show negotiated Pencil availability.
The local probe has observed contact, hover and rotation cancellation, and the
user reports force responding. On October 8 the user accepted remote pressure, navigation and tip/cursor
alignment on Flame1 with build 3. The initial offset occurred inside Flame and
resolved when the user turned off Flame Tablet Margins. Use zero Tablet Margins
for this Pencil path; do not compensate the iPad coordinate mapping globally.
Remote tilt and rotation/interruption recovery remain unqualified; compilation
and wire tests do not qualify them.

Build 4 adds persistent **Windows / PC Keyboard** and **Apple Extended Keyboard**
choices in Session Controls. F1–F12 are literal function keys in either mode;
PC maps F13–F15 to Print Screen/Scroll Lock/Pause, and Apple keeps F13–F24
literal. Hardware key edges use GCKeyboard while connected, with UIKit as the
fallback. Space receives a priority local command while the remote canvas has
focus, preventing local control activation; its actual down/up still come from
the hardware adapter. A Pencil contact preserves held keyboard shortcuts.
Focus loss, opening controls, keyboard removal and mapping changes retire held
keys. iPadOS-reserved shortcuts and keyboard media actions are not remapped;
use the keyboard's Fn key if it emits media actions instead of F-keys.

Pencil Pro squeeze sends one right mouse click (wire button 3) on gesture end,
at the supplied hover location. Lift the tip before squeezing. It does nothing
while drawing, another mouse button is held, local controls are open, or the
Pencil is outside hover range/the video area. This avoids ending an artist's
stroke or releasing a physical mouse button. Double-tap and barrel roll remain
unmapped. Apple Pencil system shortcuts can consume squeeze before the app
receives it. On October 8 the user confirmed F-keys reach Flame with Fn held on a separate
Bluetooth Apple Magic Keyboard; ordinary top-row keys still control the iPad.
The user subsequently confirmed Space during Pencil dragging and squeeze right-click
working. No iPadOS
setting reversing the keyboard's default top row has been verified.

Build 5 separates UIKit discrete wheel and continuous scroll recognizers. Each
nonzero physical-wheel callback sends one bounded 120-unit protocol notch;
continuous motion accumulates fractional units at a nominal 32 view points per
detent. Horizontal direction follows the existing Mac adapter. Cancelled events,
local controls, letterboxes and active Pencil strokes do not send scroll input.
Focus/geometry changes clear fractional motion. Bounded aggregate console counts
record locally submitted scroll events/units, not Host acknowledgment. Physical
wheel speed/direction and continuous-device behavior require device acceptance.
The user reported build 5 did not scroll. Build 6 corrects recognizer admission:
indirect-pointer input is allowed explicitly, with zero touches so contact drags
cannot become scrolling. Session Controls → Show statistics reveals received,
submitted and blocked scroll counts. They remain available after reopening the
controls, even when a launch console has ended. This is a diagnostic correction,
not a device acceptance claim.

Build 6 delivered balanced wheel-up/down events to Flame1's XInput mouse, but
the user's gedit document with hundreds of lines still did not scroll. Build 7
removes the absolute pointer update previously sent before each wheel event,
matching the accepted Mac correction: alternating XTEST pointer motion with
uinput wheel input resets GTK's scrolling baseline. Hover and contact still
position the pointer; scroll admission and unit conversion are unchanged.
Application scrolling acceptance remains pending.

Build 7 produced occasional small scrolling, which the user reported was still
mostly ignored. Build 8 suppresses stationary mouse-hover positions as another
possible source of XTEST/uinput alternation. It compares exact remote pixels,
without smoothing, and preserves contact/button positioning. Pen handoff, focus
and geometry changes reset the comparison. Scroll diagnostics include pointer
move and stationary-suppression counts; callback counts do not prove the cause
or application acceptance. Wheel scale is unchanged.

On October 8 the user accepted build 8 physical-wheel scrolling in gedit on
Flame1: "Working great now." The log shows wheel submissions continuing while
stationary hover callbacks are suppressed; during one stationary interval the
pointer-move count stayed at 88 as scroll submissions rose from 15 to 70.
This qualifies the tested physical wheel, not continuous or horizontal scrolling.

Build 9 makes the toolbar keyboard icon show/hide UIKit's keyboard while the
canvas remains the first responder. Characters go to the remote application
immediately; there is no local composition field or Send button. Backspace also
works against pre-existing remote text. Return comes from the keyboard, with
Esc, Tab and Hide Keyboard in its accessory bar. Opening controls, losing focus,
backgrounding or disconnecting hides it and retires locally held input.
Keyboard-driven viewport resizing follows the existing geometry cancellation.

Committed ASCII characters use the Vision software-keyboard mapping; other
characters use the existing UTF-8 text path. Autocorrection, capitalization and
smart punctuation are disabled. This is basic UIKeyInput, not qualified complex
IME composition. Hardware mapped keys retain their existing single-owner path.
iPadOS controls whether a full software keyboard is visible while a physical
keyboard is connected; no private keyboard-forcing API is used. Live typing,
Backspace/Return, accessory keys and hardware coexistence need device acceptance.

The user confirmed build 9 keyboard presentation works after turning off the
Bluetooth Magic Keyboard. Apple also documents switching to the onscreen keyboard
without disconnecting hardware through the bottom Shortcuts button → Show Keyboard:
[Apple iPad guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipaddd28d7ed/ipados).
No documented public API to force this system action was identified; do not use
private keyboard APIs or claim PLANK's icon forces presentation with hardware.

Build 10 adds a two-line, 24-point live typing preview above the software keyboard.
It echoes the latest 160 committed characters, follows Return/Tab and Backspace,
and clears on Escape, keyboard hide/open, focus loss and disconnect. This is a
read-only echo of software-keyboard typing, not a synchronized remote document;
remote mouse/cursor edits and physical keyboard text are not reconstructed.
Text stays in memory, is not logged/saved, and is sent live just as in build 9.
Focused checks cover grapheme deletion, CRLF, bounded length and clearing; device
preview/layout acceptance is pending.

The user accepted build 10's preview behavior, requested a smaller native style,
and reported that with Bluetooth connected only PLANK's accessory/keys appeared;
the system Show Keyboard chooser was not available. The prior Apple-guide route
therefore remains unqualified in this custom-input application.

Build 11 uses one compact preview row with the system Body font and Dynamic Type,
removing the separate heading and bespoke toolbar. Esc/Tab/Hide use native iPad
input-assistant groups. A standard UITextField owns software typing so UIKit
can provide its native hardware-keyboard shortcuts/chooser. It is an invisible
responder, stores no editable remote document, and forwards committed characters
live. Physical key edges retain the existing owner; switching responders retires
held input once without silently hiding the keyboard request. Aggregate focus/
hardware/window state can be logged, never typed text. Full native keyboard
presentation with Bluetooth attached is a device acceptance gate, not a claimed
public forcing API or proven fix. Preview is still a bounded software-text echo.


The user confirmed build 11 can display a floating keyboard with the Bluetooth
Magic Keyboard connected and expand it to full size using two fingers. This
qualifies that presentation route, not software/hardware typing coexistence.
The user then reported the accessory preview drifting after a floating/full-size
round trip. Build 12 makes the preview an app-owned view constrained to UIKit's
keyboard layout guide, with `followsUndockedKeyboard` enabled. It follows the
keyboard's width/position, stays within the canvas, and moves below a floating
keyboard near the top edge where there is no space above. Esc/Tab/Hide remain
in the native assistant. Preview hit areas do not forward input to the desktop.
No keyboard accessory or keyboard-frame notification offsets are retained.
Mode round trips, floating movement and rotation require device acceptance.
See [Apple's keyboard layout example](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/adjusting-your-layout-with-keyboard-layout-guide).

No raw Wacom driver or direct Bluetooth Wacom support is claimed. PTH-660
produced no visible probe input over USB or Bluetooth on the test iPad. The
registered Mac/Linux Relay route is the planned first Wacom path; its codecs
compile here but the enrollment/selection UI and iOS drawing qualification are
a subsequent slice. No Relay keys or approvals are imported from another app.

The shared engine retains the reviewed native recipe's exact parent/Kymux pins.
Upstream issue 9 still owns persistent trust, exact-format decoder fallback,
audio clock, input lifetime and current-parent reconciliation. This development
pilot is not a production security/precision or held-input release qualification.
Local release requests before disconnect are not proof of Host receipt: the
known shared sender shutdown ordering remains an upstream gate. No Host package
change or deployment is part of this target.

`PlankIPadVideo.swift` and `PlankIPadKeys.swift` mechanically extract the current
Vision fit/cursor container and UIKit key map; Metal presentation itself compiles
from its original shared source. These extractions are temporary pending the
agreed upstream shared-directory move, not new wire or decoder implementations.

## Unsigned build

The existing checksum/source-verified recipe accepts `ios-device` and
`ios-simulator`. Each needs its own fresh work directory and matching libraries.

```sh

are separate. Do not treat successful compilation or standalone finger/mouse
probe acceptance as a remote desktop pass.

Orientation follows Apple's [azimuth definition](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitouch/azimuthangle(in:))
and the existing Host virtual-pen convention, with four cardinal-direction
fixtures. Host observation of tilt is still required.
